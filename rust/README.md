## Rust Version of GPU fan controller

you can build it yourself with `cargo build --release` or just use the compiled binary in the bin folder

I created this version to help me learn about Rust. Im sure its pretty amateur in nature but it helped me learn. 

I am always open to constructive criticism.

Cheers,
Mark
